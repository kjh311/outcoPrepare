<h2>4. Develop a Process for Problem Solving</h2>

<h3>Read the following 4 points and ask yourself if you ascribe to some or all of these challenges:</h3>

<h4>I often find it difficult to understand what the problem is even asking.
</h4>
<h4>I can understand the problem, but am just not sure where to begin or I just blank out.</h4>
<h4>I can jump into coding quickly, but when I find errors in my logic my algorithm seems to break down and I become stuck.</h4>
<h4>I can come up with an algorithm in my head that I think might work, but I cannot seem to write it out correctly.</h4>
These are challenges that having a more structured process for problem solving would help. What you want to establish is a framework for solving problems. <h4>This framework will provide you with a list of steps and line items to check off to ensure:</h4>

<h4>you properly understand the problem</h4>
<h4>you are able to vocalize and visualize your code and talk over solutions at a high level</h4>
<h4>you can analyze your solution to determine the validity of your algorithm
</h4>you are able to translate your algorithm into code you can verify
Here is an example framework which you can adopt and modify as needed to fit your style of problem solving:

<h2>Understanding the problem
</h2>
<h4>Ask clarifying questions
</h4>
<h4>Get the inputs, outputs, constraints (time/space)
</h4><h4>Get example case, edge conditions
</h4><h4>Clarify what functions/methods you have to work with
</h4><h2>Exploration of Solutions
</h2><h4>Communicate aloud (or with interviewer)
</h4><h4>Diagramming (pencil/paper or on the whiteboard)
</h4><h4>Explain the naive solution
</h4><h4>Brainstorm
</h4><h2>Solution Analysis
</h2><h4>Complexity analysis to verify solutions
</h4><h4>Verifying solution edge conditions
</h4><h2>Coding
</h2><h4>Pseudocoding
</h4><h4>Coding out solution from pseudocode
</h4><h4>Run example cases
</h4><h4>Checking edge conditions
</h4>
<h2>Roadmap to develop a problem solving process
</h2>
Adopt a framework and print out the steps for reference.<br/><br/>
Select easier problems to practice your framework (two each day minimum).<br/> <br/>Focus on the process rather than the algorithm.<br/><br/>
Follow the steps of your framework. Focus on applying each step before moving to the next.<br/><br/>
Practice different formats: whiteboard, syntax highlighted text editor, and plain text editor.<br/><br/>
Practice your framework daily until you can execute without the printed reference.
