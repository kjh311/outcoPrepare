<h2>Linear Data Structure</h2>

<h3>Linked List</h3>

<p>When an array has no more memory next to it and can't grow, another space of memory is linked to the first part and allows the array to grow.</p>

<p>Linked List is a data structure consisting of a group of vertices (nodes) which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each vertex is composed of a data and a reference (link) to the next vertex in the sequence. </p>

<h3>Stack</h3>

<p>Last In, First out.  Whatever you add last gets removed first.</p>

<h3>Queue</h3>

<p>First In, First Out.  Whatever you add first gets removed first.  Like a line at a supermarket.</p>
